Hint,"Each algorithm solves a specific problem. The inputs and outputs depend on the characteristics of that problem. For the complexity, pay special attention to any loops or recursive calls in the pseucocode.",,,
Feedback,"These are not questions that are easy to memorize, but once you understand the essence of the algorithm, the pseudocode starts to make sense shortly thereafter.",,,
