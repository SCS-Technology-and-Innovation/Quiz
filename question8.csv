Option,100,"not to exceed the weight limit",,Nice work.
Option,0,"that both divisions be exact",,"The CLRS textbook is great study resource for this topic."
Option,0,"not to repeat vertices",,"The CLRS textbook is great study resource for this topic."
Option,0,"that none of the included vertices be neighbors",,"The CLRS textbook is great study resource for this topic."
Option,0,"separate the source from the target, respecting the capacities",,"The CLRS textbook is great study resource for this topic."
Hint,"Think of the problem definition to identify its objective function and any potential restrictions. Remember that the computational complexity of a problem is not dependent of a specific algorithm but instead characterizes the difficulty inherent in the task.",,,
Feedback,"These are not questions that are easy to memorize, but once you understand the problem formulation, it becomes easier to reconstruct the specific details.",,,
