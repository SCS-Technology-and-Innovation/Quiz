Option,0,20,,This is an internal node
Option,0,65,,This is an internal node
Option,1,90,,This is a leaf node
Option,1,36,,This is a leaf node
Option,0,82,,This is an internal node
Option,1,11,,This is a leaf node
Hint,The first key becomes the root.
    Then, recursively, smaller values go into the left branch and larger values into the right.
    Any node that has neither a left nor a right branch underneath it is a leaf.,,,
Feedback,When you are systematic and disciplined about always starting at the root and following the rules, this is an easy task.,,,
