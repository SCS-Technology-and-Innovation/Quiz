Option,1,42,,This is a leaf node
Option,0,46,,This is an internal node
Hint,"The first key becomes the root. Then, recursively, smaller values go into the left branch and larger values into the right. Any node that has neither a left nor a right branch underneath it is a leaf.",,,
Feedback,"When you are systematic and disciplined about always starting at the root and following the rules, this is an easy task.",,,
