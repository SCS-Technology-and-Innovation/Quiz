Option,1,5,,This is a leaf node
Option,0,16,,This is an internal node
Option,1,68,,This is a leaf node
Hint,"The first key becomes the root. Then, recursively, smaller values go into the left branch and larger values into the right. Any node that has neither a left nor a right branch underneath it is a leaf.",,,
Feedback,When you are systematic and disciplined about always starting at the root and following the rules, this is an easy task.,,,
